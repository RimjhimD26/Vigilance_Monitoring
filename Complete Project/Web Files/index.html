        <h2>Vigilance Monitoring for Safer Driving and Passenger Protection</h2>
        <p>When we enter a Cab or any taxi, we place our trust in the driver to get us safely 
            to our destination. However, as much as we would like to believe that 
            all drivers are responsible and reliable, there have been instances where 
            drivers have posed a threat to the safety and well-being of their passengers.
             In light of such incidents, vigilant monitoring of drivers has become a crucial 
             aspect of passenger protection. By implementing strict monitoring measures, 
             we can ensure that drivers are held accountable for their actions and that 
             passengers can feel safe and secure during their taxi rides. In this Application, 
             we have put our efforts to meet the importance of vigilant monitoring of drivers and the various 
             measures that can be taken to ensure passenger protection.</p>
